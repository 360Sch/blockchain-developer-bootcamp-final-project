## Contract Secruity
# Using Specific Compiler Pragma 
Specific compiler pragma 0.8.9 is used in contracts. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

# Proper Use of Require, Assert and Revert 
Usage of required to check if Contract state is valid

# Use Modifiers Only for Validation
All modifiers in contract is only validate data with require statements.
