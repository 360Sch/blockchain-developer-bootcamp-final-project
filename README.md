## Idea: - Automated Property Purchases
I like to use blockchain technology to simplify the conveyancing process and significantly reduce the time and cost it takes to buy and sell a property.

In future, I would also like to explore fractional property ownership so users can pool their money to buy home or commercial property for investments.

## Current Solution
-Current version 1: Using blockchain technology to enable users to book and make an downpayment for the property. Only the owner of the contract can finalize to accept the downpayment to complete the booking.

-Future version:  Time-base to automatically commplete the booking and allow owner to obtain the payment, issue NFT for property purchase.
