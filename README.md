# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

Idea:
I like to use blockchain technology to simplify the conveyancing process and significantly reduce the time and cost it takes to buy and sell a property.

In future, I also like to explore fractional property ownership so investors can pool their money to buy home or commercial property for investments
